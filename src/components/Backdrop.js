              What Is Online Banking?

               Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet.
            Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.
            Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally
            available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and
            online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some
            form of online banking you can access through a computer or app.
            
              Online banking allows you to conduct financial
            transactions via the Internet. You aren't required to visit a bank
            branch in order to complete basic online banking transactions. You
            need a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register
            for online banking.
              
               Understanding Online Banking With online
            banking, you aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most
            of your basic banking transactions. You can do all of this at your
            own convenience, wherever you wantâ€”at home, at work, or on the go.
            Online banking can be done using a browser or app.
